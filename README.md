## Requirements
- Xcode 12.0+

## Install
This project uses CocoaPods as its dependency manager, so after cloning the project.
This project have three environments, use production for greater stability.

Run the following command on the terminal:
```
$ cd /WTestProject/Example
$ ENVIRONMENT=Pro pod install
```

In some cases you will need to use the command below:
```
$ pod install --repo-update
```
## Possible problems

This issue can be resolved by clearing this directory: 'Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData'

*If you do not find the swiftLint dependency, check if the root directories up to the project base do not contain space between them, for example:
./jefferson developer/projects/myprojet (this can cause problems with scripts written in build phases) 
./jefferson_developer/projects/myprojet (correct)
